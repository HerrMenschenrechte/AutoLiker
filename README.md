# AutoLiker

A Chrome browser extension that auto-likes Instagram Posts.

## Description

The browser extension can be applied to a Instagram account page of the user's choice. Once started, it will like every picture in the user's Instagram feed by clicking "like / heart" on everything in the current viewport, then scrolling down automatically and repeating the process. Instagram does not consider it Bot activity because interactions are randomized.

## Background

This project was created to learn more about how to quickly and sustainably grow a branded Instagram account (Resonance Earphones) with the ultimate goal of driving sales for the brand through social media advertising.

Brands can ultimately use it to create engagement with their follower's content without the need of a person physically interacting with the account.
